“ACADEMIC DISHONESTY […] PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas, or work of others as one’s own. Plagiarism includes 
reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s 
own without proper citation or reference to the original source. Examples of sources from which the ideas, expressions of ideas or works of others 
may be drawn from include but are not limited to: books, articles, papers, literary compositions and phrases, performance compositions, chemical 
compounds, art works, laboratory reports, research results, calculations and the results of calculations, diagrams, constructions, computer reports, 
computer code/software, material on the internet and/or conversations. 
Examples of plagiarism include, but are not limited to: 
• any submission prepared in whole or in part, by someone else; 
• using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, paraphrased material, algorithms, formulae, scientific or mathematical concepts, or ideas without 
  appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; 
• using another's data or research findings without appropriate acknowledgement; 
• submitting a computer program developed in whole or in part by someone else, with or without modifications, as one’s own; and 
• failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another's work and/or failing to use quotations marks

[…]

SANCTIONS
If, upon reviewing all related statements and evidence, the Faculty Dean is satisfied that a violation of the Policy has occurred, the Faculty Dean 
will determine a sanction that is consistent with the offence
[…]
Sanctions that may be imposed by the Faculty Dean 
• A written reprimand. 
• Requirement to remain registered in the course in which the violation occurred. If a student has dropped the course in which the violation 
  occurred, they may be re-registered. 
• Completion of a remediation process. Completion of a remediation process may be either a sanction of its own accord or may be used to reduce a more 
  severe sanction. Examples of remediation are attendance at a Writing Tutorial or study skills workshop, completion of an academic integrity 
  computer tutorial or the submission of a new assignment for grading. 
• Resubmission of the piece of academic work in which the violation was committed, for evaluation with or without a grade penalty. 
• Assignment of a reduced grade (including a grade of zero or a failing grade) for the piece of academic work in respect of which the violation was 
  committed. 
• Assignment of a reduction of the final grade in the course in respect of which the violation was committed. 
• Assignment of a grade of unsatisfactory or failure for the course in respect of which the violation was committed. 
• Requirement that the final grade for the course not be converted to any other grade (e.g., SAT/UNS). 
• Restitution of costs incurred by the University as a result of the violation of this policy. 
• Withdrawal from the course in respect of which the violation was committed. In certain cases, the Dean may decide that the student will not be 
  allowed to enroll in the course again for up to three (3) terms. 
• An additional requirement of a maximum of 1.0 credit added to the student's program of studies. 
• Registration limited to a specified number of credits per term for up to three (3) terms. 
• Suspension for up to three (3) terms, normally beginning with the next academic term after the final decision has been made. Students are allowed 
  to complete courses that are ongoing at the time of the decision but will be withdrawn from any courses in which they have registered and which 
  would begin during the suspension. 

Additional Sanctions that may be imposed by the Provost on referral from the Faculty Dean Where the Faculty Dean has found a violation of the 
Academic Integrity Policy and has imposed a sanction, they may refer the case to the Provost for further sanctions. In referring a case to the 
Provost, the Faculty Dean may recommend that specific sanctions be imposed. Upon referral of a case from the Faculty Dean, the Provost may 
additionally impose one or more of the following penalties: 
• Suspension for more than three (3) terms normally beginning with the next academic term after the penalty is assigned. As part of a suspension 
  imposed by the Provost, the student may be required to withdraw, without academic penalty, from courses unrelated to the violation, that were 
  ongoing at the time of the imposition of the suspension. Students will be withdrawn from any courses in which they have registered and which would 
  begin during the suspension. The Dean should clearly indicate if the recommendation includes a transcript notation. The recommendation of a notation 
  may be permanent or for a limited time period. 
• In the case of suspension for more than three (3) terms, the Provost may determine that a notation be placed on the student’s transcript in the form 
  pursuant to Part IX of the Policy. The notation may be permanent or for a limited period. In the case of a limited period, the notation shall be 
  removed at the expiry of the set time limit. 
• Expulsion from the University with a notation on the student’s transcript. 
• Addition of a notation to the student’s transcript pursuant to Part IX of the Policy. 

Sanctions that may be imposed by Senate Executive on recommendation of the Provost Where the Faculty Dean has found a violation of the Academic 
Integrity Policy and has referred the case to the Provost for further sanctions, the Provost may, along with possibly adding additional sanctions, 
refer the case to Senate Executive for the rescission or suspension of one or more degrees, diplomas or certificates obtained by any graduate who, 
while enrolled at the University, committed any violation of the Policy. 
• On recommendation of the Provost, Senate Executive may impose the rescission or suspension of one or more degrees, diplomas or certificates. 
  In such cases, a notation will be made on the student’s transcript pursuant to Part IX of the Policy. 
  
IX TRANSCRIPT NOTATIONS All transcript notations shall include: 
• the reason for the notation (for example, "Suspended for academic misconduct") 
• the date the notation was applied (for example, "beginning Sept. 1, 2015") 
• the date the notation is to be removed (for example, "until Aug 31, 2018")”
